## 🎯 Test Coverage Alignment with Backend

The E2E tests are designed to mirror your backend API test cases:

| Backend Test | Frontend E2E Test | Coverage |
|--------------|-------------------|----------|
| User Management API | Authentication + User Management Tests | ✅ Complete |
| Knowledge Base API | Knowledge Base Tests | ✅ Complete |
| Agent Management API | Agent Tests | ✅ Complete |
| Group Management API | Group Tests | ✅ Complete |
| Shared Resources API | Shared Resources Tests | ✅ Complete |
| Authorization & Roles | Cross-cutting in all test suites | ✅ Complete |

## 🚀 Getting Started
