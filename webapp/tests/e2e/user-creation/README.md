# 👤 User Creation Test Suite

This directory contains comprehensive tests for new user registration, onboarding, and complete user journey flows.

## 🎯 Test Coverage

### **new-user-journey.spec.ts**

#### **Test 1: Complete User Journey**
**Full Flow: Home → Register → Login → First Use → Logout → Re-login**

**🔍 What This Tests (No Duplication with Existing Tests):**

| **Phase** | **What's Tested** | **Different from Existing Tests** |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Home Page (Anonymous)** | Homepage for non-authenticated users | ✅ Existing tests don't test anonymous homepage experience |
| **Registration Flow** | Complete signup process with validation | ✅ Extends existing basic registration tests with full flow |
| **Post-Registration** | Handles dev environment email verification bypass | ✅ New - tests dev environment specific behavior |
| **First Login** | Initial authentication with new credentials | ✅ Different from existing pre-created user logins |
| **First-Time UX** | Onboarding flow and initial feature access | ✅ New - not covered in existing tests |
| **Feature Navigation** | First-time user accessing features | ✅ New - tests user permissions from scratch |
| **Resource Creation** | Creating first knowledge base/agent | ✅ New - tests complete creation flow for new users |
| **Session Management** | Session persistence across page changes | ✅ Extends existing session tests with new user context |
| **Logout Process** | Complete logout and cleanup | ✅ Tests logout in context of new user journey |
| **Re-login Verification** | Logging back in with same credentials | ✅ New - tests account persistence |

#### **Test 2: Registration Edge Cases**
**🔍 Additional Scenarios Not in Existing Tests:**
- Registration with potentially existing emails
- Form validation edge cases
- Password strength validation in registration context
- Error handling during registration process

#### **Test 3: User Onboarding Flow**
**🔍 New Coverage:**
- Welcome screens and tutorials
- Onboarding wizard completion
- Profile setup for new users
- First-time user guidance flows

## 🚫 How This Avoids Duplication

### **Existing auth/auth.spec.ts Coverage:**
| **Existing Test** | **Our Enhancement** |
|------------------|-------------------|
| `should allow admin/paid/free user to sign in` | ✅ We test **new user first login** |
| `should allow new user registration` | ✅ We test **complete registration-to-usage flow** |
| `should allow user to sign out` | ✅ We test **logout in context of full user journey** |
| `should validate password requirements` | ✅ We test **password validation during actual registration flow** |
| `should maintain session across page refreshes` | ✅ We test **session for newly created users** |
| `should protect knowledge base routes` | ✅ We test **feature access for new users with fresh permissions** |

### **Key Differences:**
1. **Context**: Existing tests use pre-created test users; ours creates users from scratch
2. **Flow**: Existing tests test individual features; ours tests complete user journey
3. **Scope**: Existing tests are unit-focused; ours are integration-focused
4. **User State**: Existing tests assume established users; ours test first-time user experience
5. **Environment**: Ours specifically tests dev environment email verification bypass

## 🎯 Test Strategy

### **Integration vs Unit Testing:**
- **Existing auth tests**: Unit-style testing of individual auth functions
- **Our tests**: Integration-style testing of complete user lifecycles

### **User Personas:**
- **Existing tests**: Pre-established admin/paid/free users
- **Our tests**: Brand new users with no history or data

### **Realistic Scenarios:**
- **Existing tests**: Technical authentication verification
- **Our tests**: Real user behavior patterns and complete workflows

## 🚀 Running These Tests

```bash
# Run all user creation tests
npm run test:e2e -- user-creation/

# Run specific test
npm run test:e2e -- user-creation/new-user-journey.spec.ts

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui -- user-creation/

# Run in headed mode to watch the journey
npm run test:e2e:headed -- user-creation/new-user-journey.spec.ts
```

## 🔧 Test Configuration

These tests are designed to work with your existing infrastructure:

- **✅ Uses existing `AuthHelpers` and `TestHelpers`**
- **✅ Uses existing `TEST_DATA` and `SELECTORS` configurations**
- **✅ Leverages dev environment email verification bypass**
- **✅ Compatible with existing Playwright configuration**
- **✅ Follows existing error handling and debugging patterns**

## 🎯 Expected Outcomes

### **Successful Test Run Should Show:**
```
🚀 Testing complete new user journey from start to finish...
🏠 Phase 1: Starting as anonymous user on homepage...
✅ Homepage loaded successfully for anonymous user
📝 Phase 2: User registration process...
✅ Registration form submitted successfully
📧 Phase 3: Handling post-registration state...
✅ In dev, proceeding directly to verified state
🔐 Phase 4: First login attempt...
✅ First login successful
🌟 Phase 5: First-time user experience...
✅ User successfully reached main application
⚡ Phase 6: First application usage...
✅ Successfully accessed Knowledge Base
✅ Successfully created first resource
🔄 Phase 7: Testing session persistence...
✅ Session persisted after page refresh
🚪 Phase 8: Testing logout process...
✅ Logout successful, session data cleared
🔁 Phase 9: Testing re-login with same credentials...
✅ Re-login successful
🎉 COMPLETE SUCCESS: Full new user journey validated!
```

## 🐛 Debugging

If tests fail, they will:
- **Take screenshots** at failure points
- **Log detailed phase information** showing where failure occurred
- **Provide debugging URLs** and authentication states
- **Show detailed error context** for troubleshooting
